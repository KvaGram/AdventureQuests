Adventurequest
new structure in code.

When entering a location, a book object is opened.
A book object contains the following:
* Array of image assets
* Array of audio assets
* Array of video assets   (will not be implemented in these notes)
* Array of book assets (other books)
* Array of pages

Any of the above may be empty.

When displaying the contents of a book, the following may be manipulated:
* Background image
* Foreground image
* Background audio (looped)
* Foreground audio (played once)
* Foreground playrange (start and end)
* Display text
* Choices

When playrange is defined, the foreground audio shall play the defined start and end, defined in secunds.
The choice-menu is always shown, when no choices are defined, or none are enabled, a default "next page" choice shall be visible.
 

A page object must contain the following:
* Multiline string of Text

It may also contain the following:
* Array of choices
* size-2 table of start and end of foreground audio
* Background image to display
* Foreground image to display
* Background audio to play
* Foreground audio to play
* Identification tag

If the start and end object is missing, no foreground audio will be played.
If any image or audio object is missing, the previusly set object will remain in use.
IMPORTANT: image and audio objects must be defined at some point to be used.

Choices are the most programmable part of a page, and thus a book.
A choice contain an array of attributes.

An attribute may be one of the following types:
* A variable condition
* A varible setter
* A book loader
* A set page
* A hidden flag

A varible is always globally accesable, so use of underscores are wise as a way of defining scopes.
PLANNED: use of item_ scope for items the player may have in inventory.
An attribute object is an array of values, where the first value defines the type, and any following define the arguments/values.
A choice is considered disabled if any condition attribute were to return a negative.
If a hidden flag is present, the choice shall not be visible if disabled.
