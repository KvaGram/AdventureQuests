Nylium's functions were as a weapons and defence research hive.\nThe harsh climates and wildlife of The Nether proved perfect testing grounds for experimental bee-bots. It inherited Cornflower's hatred of the existing sorcerer's structure, and after the destruction of Rose and Cornflower, it became the primary plotter and planner of the hivemind.\n",
