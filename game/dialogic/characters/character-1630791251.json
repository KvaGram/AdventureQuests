Two were destroyed by Storm Masters in the retreat, four more managed to retreat to Dandelion island, but the last sub-hive, transported by three bee-bots, got lost.\nHaving lost connection with the hivemind, the sub-hive eventually took control of the three bots. With a damaged memory, and a severe lack of bees, this sub-hive knew little of who or what it was, all it knew, was that it needed more bees.\nStumbling into Herbaburg, it found the bees it needed.\n",
